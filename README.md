# Heart Stroke Prediction using ML

This project showcases the end to end implementation of am ML project to predict, 
whether an individual is likely to get a stroke or not.

The motivation behind this project was to demonstrate the ability of 
fundamental Python concepts such as classes and objects 
and Machine Learning concepts such as classification concepts.


The folder structure for the project is provided below

To implement the code, you need to 

### 1. Create a virtual environment using the command below in CMD:
       "conda create -p venv python==3.xx -y"
      Here the xx is the Python version (preferably >=3.10)

### 2. Activate the virtual environment using the command below in CMD
      "conda activate ./venv"

### 3.Run the command below inside CMD to install all the packages of requirements.txt file
    "pip install -r requirements.txt"

### 4. Once the above steps are completed then run the command below to generate all the files under the artifacts folder and finally run the web application
      4.1 "python ./src/pipeline/train_pipeline.py"
      4.2 "python ./src/pipeline/predict_pipeline.py"
      4.3 "python app.py"

The web application will soon be deployed.
